This error typically occurs when you try to run an Expo project that uses a newer version of React Native than your Expo CLI supports.  The Expo CLI might not be compatible with all the latest features or dependencies of your project's React Native version.

**Example Scenario:**

Your project's `package.json` might specify React Native 0.71, but your Expo CLI is only compatible up to 0.70.

**Code Example (package.json):**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "~0.71.0"
  }
}
```
